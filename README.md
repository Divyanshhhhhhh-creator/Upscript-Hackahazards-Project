## 📌 Problem Statement

Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq

## 🎯 Objective

Upscript empowers dyslexic students by providing an AI-assisted learning platform that enhances their cognitive processing, comprehension, and communication through adaptive text formatting, real-time assistance, and personalized reading/writing support.


##  🧠 Team & Approach

## Team Name:  
`NotLikeUs`

## Team Members:  
- Divyansh Shukla (GitHub: [@Divyanshhhhhhh-creator](https://github.com/Divyanshhhhhhh-creator)) – Frontend & AI Integration  
- Ridhima Monga – Backend Developer  
- Umang Singh – DevOps & API Integration  

## Your Approach:  
- To empower dyslexic students with accessible tools that make reading and writing easier through AI.
- Real-time simplification, accessible UI/UX, and maintaining fast, accurate AI feedback.
- Shifted from basic grammar correction to a full-fledged assistive writing companion with speech support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend: React Native (via Expo Go), TailwindCSS (via nativewind), and custom components for dyslexia-friendly UI.
- Backend: Python with FastAPI, used to serve AI functionalities and manage API requests.
- Database: MongoDB Atlas – for storing user preferences and logs if connected; currently modular for future integration.
- APIs: Groq Inference API, HuggingFace Transformers (BERT, T5) – for text simplification, summarization, grammar correction gTTS / Web Speech API – for Text-to-Speech
- Whisper / SpeechRecognition – for Speech-to-Text conversion
- Hosting: Mobile App: Run locally via Expo Go or build via Android Studio
  Backend: Can be hosted locally or optionally deployed using Render, Railway, or any cloud server (for production use)
